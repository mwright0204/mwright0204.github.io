										<h1>About Me </h1>

									</header>

									<p>
										<span class=""><img src="Images/AboutPicture.jpg" alt="" style="width:40%;height:40%;float:right;padding:2%;margin:2%" /></span>
										I found my interest in games development from an early age. At around 13 years old, I discovered a seemingly random software on the computer in my school's library and found it interesting to create 3D models. Soon I discovered you could make games in it; at that time, Blender was a game engine. Before long, I had made my own small action RPG and took my first steps in the world of game development.

									</p>
									<p>
										Of course, I had a love for games before this venture into Blender, playing on the PS2, the DS, and convincing my mother to let me play Runescape definitely cemented my interest from an early age.
									</p>
									<p>
										Despite my early interest in making games, I never thought about it as a career or even really knew it was an option. I originally wanted to do engineering, and then went into software development as a tangent from that. With my computer skills, it was only really my college tutor pushing me to go to university that made me take the step.
									</p>
									<p>
										I am very grateful for that push; now I lecture at a university in game development. I never would have imagined that was possible as a teenager, but now, between lecturing and freelance work, I can happily say game development is definitely my career.

									<h2>Experience</h2>
									<h4>Freelance Technical Artist</h4>
									<p>
										In the world of freelancing, I have worked and am working on multiple projects around the UK. More recently, I have been working with Bearly Awake Games as a contractor for their Tranzfuser team. Here I have been acting as a Technical Artist working on bespoke technical requirements for shaders, tools and particle systems.

										I have also been working with the Big C Cancer charity lately in the development of a 3d platformer aiming to help children understand cancer treatment. And in the past, I have done work for The Vampires Manor Studios, working on Foques and working with GamingYourWay, working on Foxen Island.
										<br><br>
									</p>
									<h4>University Lecturer</h4>
									<p>
										Alongside my freelance career, I have been lucky to get the position of part-time lecturer at Norwich University of the Arts. In this role, I teach Unreal and C++, supporting students' game projects and provoking idea generation with critical thinking. I have very much enjoyed my time here and have only gotten better as an educator since I started, and I have reinforced my foundational skills even more.
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Education</h2>
									<p>
										I finished university with a BSc(Hons) First Class in Games Development and am very proud of what I achieved with my time in higher education. This course allowed me to learn C++ in Unreal to a high level, as well as gave me room to experiment with what I found most interesting, technical art.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before university, I completed a BTEC Level 3 in IT(Software Development) and graduated with D*D*D* equivalent to A*A*A* at A levels. This course taught me C# programming, building a rigorous foundation in programming, and introduced me to Unreal Engine 4, among other software and areas of IT.

									<p>- Norwich University of the Arts Vice Chancellor's Commendation 2024</p>
									<p>- The Infinite Form Award: Creative Use of Technology - Shortlistee 2024</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Hobbies</h2>
									<p>
										If you read this far, you might want to know a little about me. One of my greatest hobbies would be playing, running, and making TTRPGs (Table Top Role Playing Games) such as Hunter the Reckoning, Dungeons and Dragons, etc. I love the combination of storytelling, socialising, and game design and have been working on my own TTRPG for years!
									</p>
									<p>
									I also love cooking and experimenting in the kitchen. I'm always trying new foods and expanding what I can cook at home, sharing my discoveries with friends and loved ones.
